sorry for the lack of documentation :-(   I'll get there soon!

first:  This follows the W3C Linked Data Platform (LDP:  http://www.w3.org/TR/ldp/) API, which is intended to harmonize the way that Linked Data 
services behave (at least, at a very fundamental level).  LDP is not particularly "powerful" (and is not intended to be!), it simply says
that Linked Data resources should respond in predictable and useful ways to various kinds of HTTP calls.


The purpose of the files are:

EHDN_Registry_Minimal:  This is the script that waits for HTTP calls.  It responds to a variety of HTTP methods, following the Linked Data Platform API)

RD_Connect_Common.pm:  This module contains a variety of functions that will be shared by all RD_Connect LDP services

configuration.txt :  a file of key/value pairs that establish the configuration for a particular RD Connect repository instance

EHDN_DB_Connector.pm :  this file is the one that a provider will need to write - this is specifically how to connect to their resource (maybe an SQL database behind a firewall, maybe just a text file sitting on your hard drive somehwere)
